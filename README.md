Jayways TSP challenge
==========

The goal is simple, claim the shortest path on as many of the graphs as possible. The graphs can be found in this repo in the /nodegen folder, and are named xxx_locations.csv where the xxx stands for how many nodes the graph contains.

There are a few java classes to help get you started in no time:

Using those you get reading and writing files for free as well as drawing of you path to screen to see whats going on. Compile and run TSPSolver.java to get a first ideea of what the path can look like.

And please, before changing anything in the Get_Started_With_TSP folder, make a copy of it and name it after youself :)

Claiming a sortest path is done by committing a cvs file to the repo with the path, and then updating the xsl document found here:

An example of the cvs file to commit (only the path itself is mandatory):
