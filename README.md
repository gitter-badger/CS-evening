Jayway internal TSP summer 2014 competition
==========

The goal is simple, claim the shortest path on as many of the graphs as possible.  

There are a few java classes to help get you started in no time:

Using those you get reading and writing files for free as well as drawing of you path to screen to see whats going on.

Claiming a sortest path is done by committing a cvs file to the repo with the path, and then updating the xsl document found here:

An example of the cvs file to commit (only the path itself is mandatory):
